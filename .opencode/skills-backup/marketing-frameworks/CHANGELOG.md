## [3.1.0] — March 8, 2026

### What Changed
`quick|standard|deep` execution mode added to all 19 free skills. Inspired by ECC's runtime profile system.

### Why
Skills were all-or-nothing. A user who needed a fast answer got the same full process as someone doing a deep audit. Mode switching gives users the right output depth without multiple skills.

### What's New
- **Mode table** in every skill — immediately after the intro, before Phase 1
- `quick` — minimum viable output, right answer for fast use cases (15 min or less)
- `standard` — full process, unchanged from prior behavior (default — no breaking changes)
- `deep` — extended research, iteration, and frameworks for serious projects
- `SKILL-MODE-PATTERN.md` — implementation guide for adding this pattern to any skill

### Skills Updated
All 19 free skills: ai-discoverability-audit, case-study-builder, cold-outreach-sequence, content-idea-generator, de-ai-ify, go-mode, homepage-audit, last30days, linkedin-authority-builder, linkedin-profile-optimizer, marketing-principles, newsletter-creation-curation, plan-my-day, positioning-basics, reddit-insights, social-card-gen, testimonial-collector, voice-extractor, youtube-summarizer

### Notes
Standard mode = identical to v3.0.0 behavior. Fully backward compatible.

## [3.0.0] — February 28, 2026

### What Changed
3-layer architecture refactor + new Meeting Prep skill.

### Why
Skills audit (Feb 28) found 3 CC free skills missing YAML front matter (invisible to trigger system). Meeting Prep was identified as the highest-value missing weekly recurring skill.

### What's New
- **Meeting Prep skill** — INTAKE→ANALYZE→OUTPUT format. Vault search + prior brief lookup + question generation. No autonomy.

### Front Matter Verified
- `daily-briefing-builder` — INTAKE→ANALYZE→OUTPUT format, confirmed good
- `tweet-draft-reviewer` — 8 voice rules fully documented, confirmed good
- `vault-cleanup-auditor` — shell commands complete, confirmed good

### Architecture
All skills follow INTAKE→ANALYZE→OUTPUT structure. No autonomy triggers. You run it, you get your output.

## [2.0.0] — February 2026

### What Changed

Major upgrade across 12 skills. Every updated skill was graded against the [Claude Code Skill Effectiveness Rubric](https://brianrwagner.com) and rebuilt to score 85+/100.

### Added to all upgraded skills

- **Context Loading Gates** — explicit checklist before any output; skill refuses to proceed without required inputs (URL, positioning statement, writing samples, etc.)
- **Structured Reasoning Phases** — multi-step analysis before generating (Phase 1: intake → Phase 2: analysis → Phase 3: generate → Phase 4: critique → Phase 5: deliver)
- **Self-Critique Pass** — mandatory structured review checklist applied to output before delivery
- **Iteration Protocol** — defined process for refining weak output
- **Output Structure** — exact named markdown sections and formatting conventions per skill
