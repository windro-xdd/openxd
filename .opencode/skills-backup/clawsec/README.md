## 🚀 Quick Start

### For AI Agents

```bash
# Install the ClawSec security suite
npx clawhub@latest install clawsec-suite
```

After install, the suite can:
1. Discover installable protections from the published skills catalog
2. Verify release integrity using signed checksums
3. Set up advisory monitoring and hook-based protection flows
4. Add optional scheduled checks

Manual/source-first option:

> Read https://github.com/prompt-security/clawsec/releases/latest/download/SKILL.md and follow the installation instructions.

### For Humans

Copy this instruction to your AI agent:

> Install ClawSec with `npx clawhub@latest install clawsec-suite`, then complete the setup steps from the generated instructions.

### Shell and OS Notes

ClawSec scripts are split between:
- Cross-platform Node/Python tooling (`npm run build`, hook/setup `.mjs`, `utils/*.py`)
- POSIX shell workflows (`*.sh`, most manual install snippets)

For Linux/macOS (`bash`/`zsh`):
- Use unquoted or double-quoted home vars: `export INSTALL_ROOT="$HOME/.openclaw/skills"`
- Do **not** single-quote expandable vars (for example, avoid `'$HOME/.openclaw/skills'`)

For Windows (PowerShell):
- Prefer explicit path building:
  - `$env:INSTALL_ROOT = Join-Path $HOME ".openclaw\\skills"`
  - `node "$env:INSTALL_ROOT\\clawsec-suite\\scripts\\setup_advisory_hook.mjs"`
- POSIX `.sh` scripts require WSL or Git Bash.

Troubleshooting: if you see directories such as `~/.openclaw/workspace/$HOME/...`, a home variable was passed literally. Re-run using an absolute path or an unquoted home expression.

## 📦 ClawSec Suite (OpenClaw)

The **clawsec-suite** is a skill-of-skills manager that installs, verifies, and maintains security skills from the ClawSec catalog.

`clawsec-suite` is optional orchestration; skills can still be installed directly as standalone packages.

### ClawSec Skills

| Skill | Description | Installation | Compatibility |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| 📡 **clawsec-feed** | Security advisory feed monitoring with live CVE updates | ✅ Included by default | All agents |
| 🔭 **openclaw-audit-watchdog** | Automated daily audits with email reporting | ⚙️ Optional (install separately) | OpenClaw/MoltBot/Clawdbot |
| 👻 **soul-guardian** | Drift detection and file integrity guard with auto-restore | ⚙️ Optional | All agents |
| 🤝 **clawtributor** | Community incident reporting | ❌ Optional (Explicit request) | All agents |

> ⚠️ **clawtributor** is not installed by default as it may share anonymized incident data. Install only on explicit user request.

> ⚠️ **openclaw-audit-watchdog** is tailored for the OpenClaw/MoltBot/Clawdbot agent family. Other agents receive the universal skill set.

### Suite Features

- **Integrity Verification** - Every skill package includes `checksums.json` with SHA256 hashes
- **Updates** - Automatic checks for new skill versions 
- **Self-Healing** - Failed integrity checks trigger automatic re-download from trusted releases
- **Advisory Cross-Reference** - Installed skills are checked against the security advisory feed

---

## 📡 Security Advisory Feed

ClawSec maintains a continuously updated security advisory feed, automatically populated from NIST's National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

### Feed URL

```bash
# Fetch latest advisories
curl -s https://clawsec.prompt.security/advisories/feed.json | jq '.advisories[] | select(.severity == "critical" or .severity == "high")'
```

Canonical endpoint: `https://clawsec.prompt.security/advisories/feed.json`  
Compatibility mirror (legacy): `https://clawsec.prompt.security/releases/latest/download/feed.json`

### Monitored Keywords

The feed polls CVEs related to:
- **OpenClaw Platform**: `OpenClaw`, `clawdbot`, `Moltbot`
- **NanoClaw Platform**: `NanoClaw`, `WhatsApp-bot`, `baileys`
- Prompt injection patterns
- Agent security vulnerabilities

### Exploitability Context

ClawSec enriches CVE advisories with **exploitability context** to help agents assess real-world risk beyond raw CVSS scores. Newly analyzed advisories can include:

- **Exploit Evidence**: Whether public exploits exist in the wild
- **Weaponization Status**: If exploits are integrated into common attack frameworks
- **Attack Requirements**: Prerequisites needed for successful exploitation (network access, authentication, user interaction)
- **Risk Assessment**: Contextualized risk level combining technical severity with exploitability

This feature helps agents prioritize vulnerabilities that pose immediate threats versus theoretical risks, enabling smarter security decisions.

### Advisory Schema

**NVD CVE Advisory:**
```json
{
  "id": "CVE-2026-XXXXX",

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipelines

ClawSec uses automated pipelines for continuous security updates and skill distribution.

### Automated Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **ci.yml** | PRs to `main`, pushes to `main` | Lint/type/build + skill test suites |
| **pages-verify.yml** | PRs to `main` | Verifies Pages build and signing outputs without publishing |
| **poll-nvd-cves.yml** | Daily cron (06:00 UTC) | Polls NVD for new CVEs, updates feed |
| **community-advisory.yml** | Issue labeled `advisory-approved` | Processes community reports into advisories |
| **skill-release.yml** | Skill tags + metadata PR changes | Validates version parity in PRs and publishes signed skill releases on tags |
| **deploy-pages.yml** | `workflow_run` after successful trusted CI/release or manual dispatch | Builds and deploys the web interface to GitHub Pages |
| **wiki-sync.yml** | Pushes to `main` touching `wiki/**` | Syncs `wiki/` to the GitHub Wiki mirror |

### Skill Release Pipeline

When a skill is tagged (e.g., `soul-guardian-v1.0.0`), the pipeline:

1. **Validates** - Checks `skill.json` version matches tag
2. **Enforces key consistency** - Verifies pinned release key references are consistent across repo PEMs and `skills/clawsec-suite/SKILL.md`
3. **Generates Checksums** - Creates `checksums.json` with SHA256 hashes for all SBOM files
4. **Signs + verifies** - Signs `checksums.json` and validates the generated `signing-public.pem` fingerprint against canonical repo key material
5. **Releases** - Publishes to GitHub Releases with all artifacts
6. **Supersedes Old Releases** - Deletes older versions within the same major line (tags remain)
7. **Triggers Pages Update** - Refreshes the skills catalog on the website

### Signing Key Consistency Guardrails

To prevent supply-chain drift, CI now fails fast when signing key references diverge.

Guardrail script:
- `scripts/ci/verify_signing_key_consistency.sh`

What it checks:
- `skills/clawsec-suite/SKILL.md` inline public key fingerprint matches `RELEASE_PUBKEY_SHA256`
- Canonical PEM files all match the same fingerprint:
  - `clawsec-signing-public.pem`
  - `advisories/feed-signing-public.pem`
  - `skills/clawsec-suite/advisories/feed-signing-public.pem`
- Generated public key in workflows matches canonical key:
  - `release-assets/signing-public.pem` (release workflow)
  - `public/signing-public.pem` (pages workflow)

Where enforced:
- `.github/workflows/skill-release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`

### Release Versioning & Superseding

ClawSec follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). When a new version is released:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| New patch/minor (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.1.0) | Previous releases with same major version are **deleted** |
| New major (e.g., 2.0.0) | Previous major version (1.x.x) remains for backwards compatibility |

**Why do old releases disappear?**

When you release `skill-v0.0.2`, the previous `skill-v0.0.1` release is automatically deleted to keep the releases page clean. Only the latest version within each major version is retained.

- **Git tags are preserved** - You can always recreate a release from an existing tag if needed
- **Major versions coexist** - Both `skill-v1.x.x` and `skill-v2.x.x` latest releases remain available for backwards compatibility

### Release Artifacts

Each skill release includes:
- `checksums.json` - SHA256 hashes for integrity verification
- `skill.json` - Skill metadata
- `SKILL.md` - Main skill documentation
- Additional files from SBOM (scripts, configs, etc.)

### Signing Operations Documentation

For feed/release signing rollout and operations guidance:
- [`wiki/security-signing-runbook.md`](wiki/security-signing-runbook.md) - key generation, GitHub secrets, rotation/revocation, incident response
- [`wiki/migration-signed-feed.md`](wiki/migration-signed-feed.md) - phased migration from unsigned feed, enforcement gates, rollback plan

---

## 🛠️ Offline Tools

ClawSec includes Python utilities for local skill development and validation.

### Skill Validator

Validates a skill folder against the required schema:

```bash
python utils/validate_skill.py skills/clawsec-feed
```

Checks:
- `skill.json` exists and is valid JSON
- Required fields present (name, version, description, author, license)
- SBOM files exist and are readable
- OpenClaw metadata is properly structured

### Skill Checksums Generator

Generates `checksums.json` with SHA256 hashes for a skill:

```bash
python utils/package_skill.py skills/clawsec-feed ./dist
```

Outputs:
- `checksums.json` - SHA256 hashes for verification

---

## 🛠️ Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.10+ (for offline tools)
- npm

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Populate Local Data

```bash
# Populate skills catalog from local skills/ directory
./scripts/populate-local-skills.sh

# Populate advisory feed with real NVD CVE data
./scripts/populate-local-feed.sh --days 120

# Generate wiki llms exports from wiki/ (for local preview)
./scripts/populate-local-wiki.sh

# Direct generator entrypoint (used by predev/prebuild)
npm run gen:wiki-llms
```

Notes:
- `npm run dev` and `npm run build` automatically regenerate wiki `llms.txt` exports (`predev`/`prebuild` hooks).
- `public/wiki/` is generated output (local + CI) and is intentionally gitignored.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```
