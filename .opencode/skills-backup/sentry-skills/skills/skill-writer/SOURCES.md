# Sources

This file tracks source material synthesized into `skill-writer`, plus iterative changes over time.

## Decisions

1. `skill-writer` is the single canonical workflow; `skill-creator` remains alias-only for compatibility.
2. Source breadth is the primary quality lever; synthesis cannot stop early on limited samples.
3. Provenance is stored in `SOURCES.md`, not SKILL header comments.
4. Case-study style examples are required for deeper, reusable synthesis outcomes.
5. Path guidance in `skill-writer` is agent-generic (no Claude-only root assumptions in workflow docs).

## Open gaps

1. Anthropic upstream source should be periodically re-reviewed for changes and recorded here with new retrieval dates.
2. Add concrete example `SOURCES.md` files in synthesized skills to demonstrate expected depth in practice.

## Changelog

- 2026-03-05: Initialized `SOURCES.md` with baseline source pack (local canonical, Codex upstream, Claude upstream, spec, and repo conventions).
